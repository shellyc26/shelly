Notes,,,,,,
"Annual Medicaid Budget surveys have been conducted in July and August of the year listed (i.e. SFY 2018 data were part of a survey conducted in July and August 2018). In addition to documenting policy actions states implemented in the fiscal year that just ended, each survey also documents policy actions adopted for the fiscal year that just began in most states (i.e. the report cited for the SFY 2018 data asked about policy actions implemented in SFY 2018 and policy actions adopted for SFY 2019). Data on adopted policy actions for FY 2019 can be found in the [Final Reports of all Medicaid Budget Surveys](http://kff.org/medicaid/report/medicaid-budget-survey-archives/), but are not included on this site because adopted policies are sometimes delayed or not implemented for reasons related to legal, fiscal, administrative, systems, or political considerations, or due to delays in approval from CMS.",,,,,,

Definitions,,,,,,
"*Opioid Quantity Limits*: Quantity limits are limits on the amount of drugs covered over a set period of time. Several states mentioned plans to implement quantity limits based on a ""morphine equivalent dose"" (MED), which is the amount of opioid prescription drugs, converted to a common ""standard"" unit (milligrams of morphine). For example, both 60 mg of oxycodone (approximately 2 tablets of oxycodone sustained-release 30 mg) and approximately 20 mg of methadone (4 tablets of methadone 5 mg) are equal to 90 MMEs (morphine milligram equivalents).",,,,,,
,,,,,,
"*Clinical Criteria Claim System Edits*: ""Clinical edits"" are clinically-based claims adjudication rules that a claims system will follow when processing a pharmacy claim, subject to prior authorization override. ",,,,,,
,,,,,,
*Step Therapy Prior Authorization Criteria*: Step therapy prior authorization criteria involves requiring the use of another agent prior to the use of a specific opioid.,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"*Required Use of Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs*: Requirements that prescribers check the state's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) before prescribing opioids. PDMPs are state-run electronic databases that are valuable tools for addressing prescription drug diversion and abuse. As of FY 2018, except for Missouri, every state and the District of Columbia operated a PDMP. ",,,,,,
,,,,,,
*Any Opioid Management Strategies In Place*: State has one or more of the specified pharmacy benefit management strategies for opioids in place as of SFY 2018. ,,,,,,
,,,,,,
"*State Fiscal Year (SFY)*: For most states, the state fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30.  For example, SFY 2018 for most states ran from July 1, 2017 through June 30, 2018.  Exceptions include AL, DC, and MI (October 1 through September 30), NY (April 1 through March 31) and TX (September 1 through August 31).",,,,,,
